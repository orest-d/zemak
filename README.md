# ZeMaK
ZeMaK (pi Zero Macro Keyboard) is a simplictic macro keyboard taking an advantage of a Raspberry Pi Zero ability to became a "gadget", in this case keyboard.
After you connect Raspberry Pi Zero W (with ZeMaK installed) via USB to a computer, Pi boots in a couple of seconds and starts a web application.
Webapp can send predefined keyboard macros to the computer as if it would be typed on a keyboard.

You can define multiple screens of macros by changing the macros.yaml file.
